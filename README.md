# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

My AI aim to detect the open sapce of the top lane of the enemy chunk and adjust the piece so it can let as musch open squares go through the open sapce as possible, so it perform better when the space gets smaller. However, it does not act in first several rows(I spent 4 hrs to debug but cannot figure out why)
Apologies for the mess. YMMV.
